# SalApp
A MVP for an internship application exam.

The steps to learn this was to fully implement the tutorial on Poll making in Django, understand different functions and python files in the project, learn how to make it RESTful through framework installation and turning views through serializer. Then get an  ERD done to represent the minimum information needed to retrieve a music list of songs, albums and artists and format it to a rest framework JSON format output. With an additional admin page tweak to show the list in a more meaningful matter on the backend.
